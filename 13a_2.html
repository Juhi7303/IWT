    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>
        Banasthali Vidyapith is a fully residential women's higher education institute which offers an integrated
        system extending from the primary to the Ph.D. level.

    <p>
        It was on October 6, 1935 that Smt. Ratan Shastri and Pandit Hiralal Shastri founded Banasthali to fill up
        the vacuum caused by the sudden death of their highly talented and promising daughter Shantabai. They had
        high expectations that she would work for women's cause when she would grow up. But  destiny  ordained 
        otherwise.
        Thus, Banasthali  owes its existence neither to the zeal of an educationist, nor to that of a social
        reformer. It is also not the creation of a Philanthropist's purse. It has arisen like the fabled phoenix
        from the ashes of a blossoming flower Shantabai.

        Banasthali is one of the five higher education institute in India meant exclusively for Women. Over these
        seventy five years Banasthali has developed into a National Centre for women's education. Banasthali's
        educational programme aims at an all-round development of the student's personality. To achieve its
        objective of 'synthesis of spiritual values and scientific achievements of the East and the West', it has
        evolved Five-fold Educational Programme (Panchmukhi Shiksha) comprising of  the following aspects : (i)
        Physical, (ii) Practical, (iii) Aesthetic, (iv) Moral and (v) Intellectual. This way the students develop an
        integrated and balanced personality.

        The rural ambience of Banasthali Vidyapith is very conducive for promoting the ideology of simple living,
        and for imbibing and internalizing the values of self-reliance and tolerance. Following the philosophy of
        the balanced Panchmukhi system of education, the institute provides ample opportunities for integrated
        development of the personality. The stress on the positive aspects of the Indian heritage has resulted in a
        climate which has contributed significantly to the task of the upliftment of women to enable them to take on
        leadership roles with confidence.

        This institute has made full use of the autonomy provided under the deemed university status and has
        innovatively restructured the courses offered which include subjects ranging from the traditional as well
        the emerging areas to the highest level of research (leading to the doctoral degree). Banasthali has been
        accredited by National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) with 'A' Grade (Five star Rating).
        Banasthali is a recipient of SANTBAL Award in the year 2000 for the services in the field of all round
        education of women.
