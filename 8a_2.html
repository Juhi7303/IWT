                A <b>laptop computer or notebook computer</b>, also laptop or notebook for short, is a small,
                portable personal computer (PC). Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with a flat panel
                screen (usually 11-17 in or 280-430 mm in diagonal size) on the inside of the upper lid, and an
                alphanumeric keyboard (typically QWERTY) on the inside of the lower lid, although 2-in-1 PCs with a
                detachable keyboard are often marketed as laptops or as having a "laptop mode". The internal
                hardwares are fitted inside the lower lid enclosure under the keyboard, and it's not uncommon for
                laptops to have a pointing device such as a trackpad or trackpoint. Many modern laptops also have a
                built-in webcam and even a touch screen display.

                Laptops run on both AC power supply and rechargeable battery pack, and can be folded shut for 
                convenient storage and transportation, and thus are suitable for mobile use. Today, laptops are
                used in a variety of settings, such as at work (especially on business trips), in education, for
                playing games, web browsing, for personal multimedia, and for general home computer use.

                The names laptop and notebook reference the fact that the computer can be practically placed on (top
                of) the user's lap, and can be used similarly to a notebook. As of 2022, in American English, the
                terms laptop computer and notebook computer are used interchangeably; in other dialects of
                English, one or the other may be preferred. Although the terms notebook computers or notebooks
                originally referred to a specific size of laptop (originally smaller and lighter than mainstream
                laptops of the time), the terms have come to mean the same thing and notebook no longer refers to
                any specific size.

                Laptops combine many of the input/output components and capabilities of a desktop computer,
                including the display screen, small speakers, a keyboard, data storage device, pointing devices
                (such as a touch pad or pointing stick), with an operating system, a processor (Central processing
                unit (CPU)) and memory into a single unit. Most modern laptops feature integrated webcams and built
                in microphones, while many also have touchscreens. Laptops can be powered either from an internal
                battery or by an external power supply from an AC adapter. Hardware specifications, such as the
                processor speed and memory capacity, significantly vary between different types, models and price
                points.

                Design elements, form factor and construction can also vary significantly between models depending
                on the intended use. Examples of specialized models of laptops include rugged notebooks for use in
                construction or military applications, as well as low production cost laptops such as those from the
                One Laptop per Child (OLPC) organization, which incorporate features like solar charging and semi
                flexible components not found on most laptop computers. Portable computers, which later developed
                into modern laptops, were originally considered to be a small niche market, mostly for specialized
                field applications, such as in the military, for accountants, or traveling sales representatives. As
                portable computers evolved into modern laptops, they became widely used for a variety of purposes.
