                <b>Glasses</b>, also known as <b>eyeglasses</b> or <b>spectacles</b>, are vision eyewear with lenses
                (clear or tinted) mounted in a frame that holds them in front of a person's eyes, typically
                utilizing a bridge over the nose and hinged arms (known as temples or temple pieces) that rest over
                the ears.
            </p>

                Glasses are typically used for vision correction, such as with reading glasses and glasses used for
                nearsightedness; however, without the specialized lenses, they are sometimes used for cosmetic
                purposes.

                Safety glasses provide eye protection against flying debris for construction workers or lab
                technicians; these glasses may have protection on the sides of the eyes as well as in the lenses.
                Some types of safety glasses are used to protect against visible and near-visible light or
                radiation. Glasses are worn for eye protection in some sports, such as squash.

                Glasses wearers may use a strap to prevent the glasses from falling off. Wearers of glasses that are
                used only part of the time may have the glasses attached to a cord that goes around their neck to
                prevent the loss and breaking of the glasses. The loss of glasses would be detrimental to those
                working in these conditions.

                Sunglasses allow for better vision in bright daylight and may protect one's eyes against damage from
                excessive levels of ultraviolet light. Typical sunglasses lenses are tinted for protection against
                bright light or polarized to remove glare; photochromic glasses are blacked out or lightly tinted in
                dark or indoor conditions, but turn into sunglasses when they come into contact with ultraviolet
                light. Most over-the-counter sunglasses do not have corrective power in the lenses; however, special
                prescription sunglasses can be made. People with conditions that have photophobia as a primary
                symptom (like certain migraine disorders or Irlen syndrome) often wear sunglasses or precision
                tinted glasses, even indoors and at night.

                Specialized glasses may be used for viewing specific visual information, for example, 3D glasses for
                3D films (stereoscopy). Sometimes glasses are worn purely for fashion or aesthetic purposes. Even
                with glasses used for vision correction, a wide range of fashions are available, using plastic,
                metal, wire, and other materials for frames.
