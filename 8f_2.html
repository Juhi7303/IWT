            Tableware is any dish or dishware used for setting a table, serving food, and dining. It includes
            cutlery, glassware, serving dishes, and other items for practical as well as decorative purposes. The
            quality, nature, variety and number of objects varies according to culture, religion, number of diners,
            cuisine and occasion. For example, Middle Eastern, Indian or Polynesian food culture and cuisine
            sometimes limits tableware to serving dishes, using bread or leaves as individual plates. Special
            occasions are usually reflected in higher quality tableware.

                Cutlery is more usually known as silverware or flatware in the United States, where cutlery usually
                means knives and related cutting instruments; elsewhere cutlery includes all the forks, spoons and
                other silverware items. Outside the US, flatware is a term for "open-shaped" dishware items such as
                plates, dishes and bowls (as opposed to "closed" shapes like jugs and vases). Dinnerware is another
                term used to refer to tableware, and <b>crockery refers to ceramic tableware</b>, today often
                porcelain or bone china. Sets of dishes are referred to as a table service, dinner service or
                service set. Table settings or place settings are the dishes, cutlery and glassware used for formal
                and informal dining. In Ireland, such items are normally referred to as delph, the word being an
                English language phonetic spelling of the word Delft, the town from which so much delftware came.
                Silver service or butler service are methods for a butler or waiter to serve a meal.

                Setting the table refers to arranging the tableware, including individual place settings for each
                diner at the table as well as decorating the table itself in a manner suitable for the occasion.
                Tableware and table decoration are typically more elaborate for special occasions. Unusual dining
                locations demand tableware be adapted.
