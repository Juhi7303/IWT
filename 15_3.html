    <h1>What is World Wide Web</h1>
    <p id="p1">
        <span class="highlight">World Wide Web</span>, which is also known as a Web, is a <span
        class="highlight">collection of websites or web pages</span> stored in web servers and connected to local
        computers through the internet. These websites contain text pages, digital images, audios, videos, etc.
        Users can access the content of these sites from any part of the world over the internet using their devices
        such as computers, laptops, cell phones, etc. The WWW, along with internet, enables the retrieval and
        display of text and media to your device.
        The building blocks of the Web are web pages which are formatted in HTML and connected by links called
        "hypertext" or hyperlinks and accessed by HTTP. These links are electronic connections that link related
        pieces of information so that users can access the desired information quickly. Hypertext offers the
        advantage to select a word or phrase from text and thus to access other pages that provide additional
        information related to that word or phrase.
        A web page is given an online address called a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). A particular collection of
        web pages that belong to a specific URL is called a website, e.g., www.facebook.com, www.google.com, etc.
        So, the World Wide Web is like a huge electronic book whose pages are stored on multiple servers across the
        world.
        Small websites store all of their WebPages on a single server, but big websites or organizations place their
        WebPages on different servers in different countries so that when users of a country search their site they
        could get the information quickly from the nearest server.
        So, the web provides a communication platform for users to retrieve and exchange information over the
        internet. Unlike a book, where we move from one page to another in a sequence, on World Wide Web we follow a
        web of hypertext links to visit a web page and from that web page to move to other web pages. You need a
        browser, which is installed on your computer, to access the Web.

    <h2>Difference between World Wide Web and Internet:</h2>
    <p id="p2">
        Some people use the terms 'internet' and 'World Wide Web' interchangeably. They think they are the same
        thing, but it is not so. <span class="highlight">Internet is entirely different from WWW</span>. It is a
        worldwide network of devices like computers, laptops, tablets, etc. It enables users to send emails to other
        users and chat with them online. For example, when you send an email or chatting with someone online, you
        are using the internet. But, when you have opened a website like google.com for information, you are using
        the World Wide Web; a network of servers over the internet. You request a webpage from your computer using a
        browser, and the server renders that page to your browser. Your computer is called a client who runs a
        program (web browser), and asks the other computer (server) for the information it needs.
