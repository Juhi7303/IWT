                A <b>mobile phone</b> is a portable telephone that can make and receive calls over a radio frequency
                link while the user is moving within a telephone service area. The radio frequency link establishes
                a connection to the switching systems of a mobile phone operator, which provides access to the
                public switched telephone network (PSTN). Modern mobile telephone services use a cellular network
                architecture and, therefore, mobile telephones are called cellular telephones or cell phones in
                North America. In addition to telephony, digital mobile phones (2G) support a variety of other
                services, such as text messaging, multimedia messagIng, email, Internet access, short-range wireless
                communications (infrared, Bluetooth), business applications, video games and digital photography.
                Mobile phones offering only those capabilities are known as feature phones; mobile phones which
                offer greatly advanced computing capabilities are referred to as smartphones.

                The first handheld mobile phone was demonstrated by Martin Cooper of Motorola in New York City in
                1973, using a handset weighing c. 2 kilograms (4.4 lbs). In 1979, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
                (NTT) launched the world's first cellular network in Japan. In 1983, the DynaTAC 8000x was the first
                commercially available handheld mobile phone. From 1983 to 2014, worldwide mobile phone
                subscriptions grew to over seven billion; enough to provide one for every person on Earth. In the
                first quarter of 2016, the top smartphone developers worldwide were Samsung, Apple and Huawei;
                smartphone sales represented 78 percent of total mobile phone sales. For feature phones (slang:
                "dumbphones") as of 2016, the top-selling brands were Samsung, Nokia and Alcatel.

                Mobile phones are considered an important human invention as it has been one of the most widely used
                and sold pieces of consumer technology. The growth in popularity has been rapid in some places, for
                example in the UK the total number of mobile phones overtook the number of houses in 1999. Today
                mobile phones are globally ubiquitous, and in almost half the world's countries, over 90% of the
                population own at least one.
