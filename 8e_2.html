                Cars run on gasoline... and people run on tea and coffee (at least in my house)! If you drink coffee
                or tea by the bucket, you'll be glad someone once had the gumption to invent a super-efficient way
                of turning cold water into hot—namely, the <b>electric kettle</b> (also known as an electric tea
                kettle). Fill it with water, plug it in, switch it on, and in a couple of minutes you have piping
                hot water ready for drinking or cooking. How exactly does a kettle work? Why does it take so long to
                boil? And how does it know when to switch itself off? Let's take a closer look!
            </p>
            <h3>What is an electric kettle?</h3>
            <p>
                Kettles are among the simplest of household appliances. Lift the lid and peer inside and you'll see,
                at the very bottom of the water container, a coil of thick metal called the heating element. When
                you plug the kettle into an electrical outlet, a large electric current flows into the heating
                element. The element's resistance (the tendency any material has to stop electricity flowing through
                it) turns the electrical energy into heat. In other words, the element gets hot. Since it's in
                direct contact with cold water, the heat passes to the water by conduction and rapidly warms it up
                too.

            <h3>How long does a kettle take to boil?</h3>
            <p>
                You can boil water in all kinds of ways—even in a simple pan on an open fire or stove—though an
                enclosed kettle is usually much faster: it stops heat escaping, allows the pressure to rise faster
                (remember that water boils when its saturated vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure), and helps
                the water to boil more quickly. But do you ever get frustrated at how long it takes your kettle to
                boil? Don't! The amazing thing is that your kettle boils as quickly as it does—and here's why.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you keep pumping heat energy into the bottom of a kettle (faster than heat is escaping through
                the top and the sides), sooner or later the water inside it will boil. A basic law of physics called
                the conservation of energy tells us that if you need to boil a liter of water, starting from the
                same temperature, you'll always have to add the same amount of energy to do it. Whether you use a
                camp fire or a kettle, a microwave or some amazing stirring device in the manner of James Prescott
                Joule , the amount of energy you have to put in to boil the water is exactly the
                same.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's say you start with 1 liter (roughly 1 kilogram, 2.2 lbs) of cold water at about 10°C (50°F)
                and you want to raise it 90°C to its boiling point (100°C or 212°F). The amount of energy you need
                is 4.2 × 1000 grams × 90 degrees = 378,000 joules or 378 kJ.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mysterious "4.2" is a constant value called the specific heat capacity of water. Every material
                has a different specific heat capacity, which is simply the amount of energy you have to put in to
                raise the temperature of one gram of the material by one degree centigrade. You need to add 4.2
                joules of energy to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1°C, so water's specific heat
                capacity is 4.2 J/g/°C.
            </p>
            <p>
                378kJ to boil a liter of water is rather more energy than you might think. An energy-efficient lamp
                rated at 10 watts uses 10 joules of energy every second (because 1 watt means using one joule per
                second), so it would take it 37,800 seconds—about 10.5 hours—to use as much energy as our kettle
                uses in a single boil!
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're using an electric kettle rated at 2400 watts, that means it's consuming 2400 joules of
                electrical energy per second and putting (roughly) the same amount of energy into the water as heat
                each second as well. Divide 378,000 by 2400 and you find it takes the kettle about 160 seconds to do
                the job, which sounds about right—an electric kettle generally does take about 2–3 minutes to boil.
                An old proverb says a watched pot (kettle) never boils, but that dates from the time when most
                people used to boil water on hideously inefficient open coal fires. An electric kettle can boil
                water in just a couple of minutes because it can add heat energy to the water much more quickly and
                efficiently than an open fire (which allows heat to escape in all directions).
            </p>
            <p>
                If your kettle were rated at something like 2400 watts (W) and you were using a UK power supply of
                240 volts (V), that means the current passing through the element would be 2400 / 240 or 10 amps
                (A). By household standards, that's a hefty current: in comparison, the little charger I have for my
                iPod draws a maximum current of 0.67 amps—the kettle is using 15 times more! So the answer to how an
                electric kettle works so quickly is by using a relatively large electric current. The amount of heat
                produced is proportional to the current squared, so bigger currents produce much more heat—and heat
                things much more quickly—than smaller ones.
